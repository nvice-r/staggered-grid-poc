# Finding Optimal Position Algorithm

#### Candidates
The items, which are the first fully displayed on the top of viewport, getting by `findFirstCompletelyVisibleItemPositions` from LayoutManager.

These items will be calculated to find the only optimal one by the algorithm using the above item called **criterian**.

#### Criterian
An item that is sectored into parts, depends on a `spanCount` of the `RecyclerView`.
